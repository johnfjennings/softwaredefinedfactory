# IIoT Trend #2: OT Cybersecurity Becomes a Board-Level Priority

The convergence of IT and OT networks has created the most complex attack surface industrial organisations have ever faced. In 2026, cybersecurity is no longer just an IT department concern - it is a core business resilience metric that demands board-level attention and investment.

## The Scale of the Problem

The numbers are stark:

- **90% of OT organisations** experienced at least one intrusion in the past year
- **60% of breaches** now impact both IT and OT environments, up from 49% previously
- **73% of organisations** reported an intrusion impacting their OT systems
- IoT malware attacks increased **45% year-over-year** due to botnet proliferation

The Global OT Security Market is projected to grow from USD 26.08 billion in 2025 to USD 63.08 billion by 2031, reflecting the urgency of the threat.

## 2026 Use Case: Zero Trust Microsegmentation in a Process Plant

A chemical plant implements zero trust microsegmentation across its control network. Each PLC and HMI is placed in its own microsegment, communicating only with explicitly authorised peers. When a compromised contractor laptop attempts to scan the network, the microsegmentation layer contains the threat to a single segment - preventing lateral movement to safety-critical systems.

The plant deploys protocol-aware deep packet inspection that understands Modbus, EtherNet/IP, and OPC UA traffic, flagging anomalous commands that traditional IT firewalls would miss entirely.

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **IT/OT convergence blind spots** | Connecting previously air-gapped OT networks to enterprise IT creates entry points for malware |
| **Legacy equipment** | Many PLCs and SCADA systems run decades-old firmware that cannot be patched |
| **Skills gap** | 47% of organisations cite OT security skills shortages as their top challenge; 51% lack ICS/OT certification |
| **AI as a double-edged sword** | AI accelerates both threat detection and attacker capabilities |
| **Regulatory pressure** | NIS2 directive implementation and CISA's Cybersecurity Performance Goals 2.0 impose new compliance requirements |

## State-Sponsored Threats Are Escalating

The VOLTZITE threat group - linked to China's Volt Typhoon operations - spent 2025 methodically positioning itself within critical infrastructure, compromising routers at electric utilities and telecommunications providers. In 2026, security researchers predict this reconnaissance will transition into operational deployment.

## What This Means for Your Factory

The shift is clear: move from prevention-only thinking to **operational resilience**. This means:

1. Implement network segmentation between IT and OT
2. Deploy multi-factor authentication for all remote OT access
3. Maintain offline backups of engineering workstation configurations
4. Adopt protocol-aware monitoring that understands industrial communications
5. Build incident response plans that account for OT-specific scenarios
