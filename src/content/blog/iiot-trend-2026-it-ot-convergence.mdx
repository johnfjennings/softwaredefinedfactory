# IIoT Trend #9: IT/OT Convergence Accelerates With Industry 5.0

For decades, Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) operated in separate silos - different teams, different networks, different priorities. IT focused on data, applications, and business systems. OT focused on machines, processes, and production uptime.

In 2026, that separation is no longer sustainable. Every major IIoT initiative - Edge AI, digital twins, predictive maintenance, computer vision - requires seamless data flow between OT and IT systems.

## Why Convergence Is Accelerating

Several forces are pushing IT and OT together:

- **AI demands OT data** - machine learning models need real-time sensor data that lives in OT systems
- **Cloud and edge hybrid architectures** bridge the physical and digital worlds
- **Standardised protocols** (OPC UA, MQTT, Sparkplug B) replace proprietary fieldbus systems
- **Business pressure** - executives want unified visibility across production, supply chain, and finance

## The ISA-95 Framework

The ISA-95 standard provides a proven framework for IT/OT convergence, defining five levels:

| Level | System | Domain |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0-2 | Sensors, PLCs, SCADA | OT |
| 3 | MES, batch management | IT/OT boundary |
| 4 | ERP, supply chain, analytics | IT |

The Unified Namespace (Trend #6) maps directly to this model, providing a single data layer that spans all levels.

## 2026 Use Case: Unified Production Intelligence

A consumer goods manufacturer connects its OT systems (40 PLCs across 8 packaging lines) to its IT stack (SAP ERP, Azure cloud, Power BI) via a Unified Namespace. The convergence enables:

- **Real-time OEE dashboards** that pull data directly from PLCs rather than manual entry
- **Automatic production order updates** - when a batch completes on the line, SAP is updated within seconds
- **AI-driven demand sensing** - cloud-based models combine sales data (IT) with production capacity data (OT) to optimise schedules
- **Energy management** - correlating energy meter data (OT) with production output to calculate cost-per-unit in real time

The manufacturer reduces reporting lag from 24 hours to real time and identifies USD 1.2 million in annual energy waste.

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cultural divide** | IT and OT teams have different priorities (uptime vs. innovation), risk tolerances, and vocabulary |
| **Security risks** | Connecting OT to IT expands the attack surface; 60% of breaches now span both environments |
| **Legacy protocols** | Many OT systems use proprietary protocols that require gateways and translation layers |
| **Data ownership** | Who owns the data? Who is responsible for data quality? Governance must be defined upfront |
| **Change management** | Convergence requires new roles (e.g., OT security engineer), new processes, and new organisational structures |

## Industry 5.0: Human-Centric Convergence

While Industry 4.0 focused on technology-driven automation, Industry 5.0 adds a human-centric dimension. IT/OT convergence in the Industry 5.0 framework prioritises:

- **Worker empowerment** - using converged data to augment human decision-making, not replace it
- **Sustainability** - leveraging unified data to reduce waste, energy, and emissions
- **Resilience** - building systems that adapt to disruptions rather than just optimising for efficiency

## What This Means for Your Factory

Start by mapping your current IT and OT data flows. Identify the top three data gaps that prevent visibility or automation. Then deploy a lightweight integration layer (MQTT broker or OPC UA server) to bridge those gaps before attempting a full convergence programme.
