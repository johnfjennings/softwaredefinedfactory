# IIoT Trend #10: Energy Monitoring and Sustainability Driven by IIoT

Energy is typically the third-largest operating cost in manufacturing, after raw materials and labour. In 2026, the combination of rising energy prices, carbon reduction mandates, and affordable IoT sensors is making real-time energy monitoring a standard capability in smart factories.

## The Business Case

The numbers make energy monitoring one of the highest-ROI IIoT investments:

- Manufacturing accounts for approximately **33% of global energy consumption**
- Typical energy waste in factories ranges from **15-30%** due to compressed air leaks, idle equipment, and inefficient processes
- IIoT-enabled energy management systems can reduce energy costs by **10-25%**
- Payback periods for energy monitoring deployments are typically **6-18 months**

## What IIoT Enables

Traditional energy management relies on monthly utility bills - far too infrequent to identify waste or optimise consumption. IIoT changes this:

### Real-Time Visibility
Sub-metering individual machines and production lines reveals where energy is actually consumed. CT clamps and power analysers connected via IoT gateways stream data every second.

### Anomaly Detection
AI models learn normal energy profiles for each machine and shift pattern. Deviations - such as a compressor running 40% harder than normal - trigger immediate alerts.

### Demand Response
IIoT systems can automatically shed non-critical loads during peak pricing periods, shift energy-intensive processes to off-peak hours, and optimise HVAC based on occupancy and production schedules.

### Carbon Accounting
Real-time energy data feeds directly into ESG reporting systems, replacing estimates with measured values for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

## 2026 Use Case: Compressed Air Optimisation

A plastics manufacturer deploys IoT pressure, flow, and power sensors across its compressed air system - the single largest energy consumer in the plant at 35% of total electrical load.

The system identifies:
- **23 air leaks** costing USD 47,000 per year (detected via ultrasonic sensors and flow anomalies)
- **Two compressors running unnecessarily** during low-demand shifts
- **Pressure set 15 PSI higher than needed** for actual production requirements

After fixing leaks, implementing demand-based compressor sequencing, and reducing system pressure, the plant cuts compressed air energy costs by 31% - saving USD 186,000 annually on a USD 45,000 sensor investment.

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Sub-metering cost** | Instrumenting every machine requires sensors, wiring, and gateways; prioritise high-consumption assets first |
| **Data integration** | Energy data must be correlated with production data (from MES/SCADA) to calculate meaningful KPIs like kWh per unit |
| **Legacy equipment** | Older machines may lack digital interfaces; CT clamps and non-invasive sensors provide a retrofit path |
| **Behavioural change** | Operators must understand how their actions impact energy consumption; dashboards and gamification help |
| **Regulatory complexity** | ESG reporting standards (CSRD, SEC climate rules) are evolving; systems must be flexible enough to adapt |

## Energy-Efficient Edge Hardware

The new generation of edge devices is running complex AI models on a fraction of the energy older systems needed. Neuromorphic chips that mimic how human brains work process data while consuming minimal power. For manufacturers with hundreds of sensors, this means AI deployment in remote locations that would previously have been impractical.

## What This Means for Your Factory

Start with your largest energy consumers - typically compressed air, HVAC, and large motors. Deploy IoT energy monitors and establish a baseline. You cannot reduce what you do not measure. The ROI from eliminating waste typically funds the next phase of your IIoT rollout.
