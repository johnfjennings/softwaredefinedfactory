# IIoT Trend #4: Private 5G Networks Become the Factory Backbone

Legacy wired networks, overextended Wi-Fi, and fragmented device ecosystems were never designed for continuous, real-time industrial workloads. In 2026, private 5G networks are rapidly becoming the connectivity infrastructure that unlocks the full potential of AI, automation, and IIoT on the factory floor.

## Why Legacy Networks Fall Short

High-frequency OT data from critical equipment is often siloed in networks not designed for modern smart factory demands:

- **Wi-Fi** suffers from interference, limited range, and unreliable handoffs in metal-rich factory environments
- **Wired Ethernet** is expensive to retrofit and lacks mobility for AGVs and mobile robots
- **Legacy fieldbus** protocols cannot support the data throughput needed for computer vision and digital twins

## What Private 5G Delivers

| Capability | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Bandwidth** | Up to 10 Gbps (Enhanced Mobile Broadband) |
| **Latency** | Sub-1ms (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications) |
| **Device density** | Up to 1 million devices per square kilometre |
| **Security** | Private, isolated network with SIM-based authentication |
| **Mobility** | Seamless handoff for AMRs, drones, and mobile workers |

## 2026 Use Case: Connected Autonomous Logistics

An automotive assembly plant deploys a private 5G network to support 50 autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) that transport components between stations. The network provides:

- Real-time path planning updates with sub-5ms latency
- Simultaneous HD video feeds from AMR cameras for obstacle detection
- Connectivity for 3,000 IoT sensors monitoring equipment health across the plant

The same network supports AR headsets for maintenance technicians, overlaying repair instructions and digital twin data in real time. Ericsson's own Smart Factory has seen output per employee increase 120% through similar 5G-enabled automation.

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Spectrum licensing** | Acquiring and managing 5G spectrum varies by country and can be complex |
| **Upfront cost** | Private 5G infrastructure requires significant capital investment compared to Wi-Fi |
| **Integration with legacy OT** | Existing PLCs and SCADA systems may need protocol gateways to interface with 5G |
| **Skills gap** | IT teams familiar with IP networking may lack experience with cellular network operations |
| **Coexistence** | Managing interference between private 5G, Wi-Fi, and other wireless systems requires careful RF planning |

## Beyond Standard 5G

Researchers have introduced PHWAN (Private Hybrid Wireless Access Network), which brings multiple wireless systems — including 5G, Wi-Fi, and low-power industrial networks — under one intelligent control framework. Early results show this approach can halve network latency compared with conventional 5G while reducing energy consumption by more than 60%.

## What This Means for Your Factory

If you are planning a greenfield facility or a major network upgrade, evaluate private 5G as the primary wireless infrastructure. For brownfield sites, start with a targeted deployment in a high-value area — such as an AMR corridor or a quality inspection zone — and expand from there.
